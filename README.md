# red-trul: RED TRanscode & UpLoad

`red-trul` is a lightweight utility designed to non-interactively conditionally transcode FLAC releases, generating and uploading torrents.

- Detects the edition and media (_edition group_) of a release.
- Transcodes `Lossless` and `24-bit Lossless` to `Lossless`, `MP3 (320)`, and `MP3 (V0)` when the edition group lacks the specific transcode.
- Copies image files from the original, excluding everything else.
- Maintains the original folder structure.
- Rejects releases with bad tagging or incorrect bit-rate (for 24-bit FLAC).

## API access

at RED. No further authorization is needed.

## Advanced: post-download hook and watch directory.

This script runs well non-interactively. Post-download example scripts are
available for [qbittorrent](./qbittorrent-postdl.sh) and
[rtorrent](./rtorrent-postdl.sh). Beside configuring a post-download script for
the torrent client, also configure it to use the torrent-dir of trul as watch
dir for new torrents, and download those to the transcode dir to start seeding.

On Linux, use `red-trul-flock` to avoid running multiple instances of red-trul.
This waits until the current invocation finishes before starting, like a queue.
